This is my master's degree project. The aim of this project is to investigate smart tourism in IoT and to investigate which data analysis techniques are used in this field. I have found 8 different types of data analytic techniques. I added simple python codes for each techniques with releated smart tourism. At the end of the project i have found a dataset about smart tourism and implement all of the data analytic techniques and compare them.
